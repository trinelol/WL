    <h1>WANDERLUST</h1>

    <h3>- a strong desire to wander</h3>

    <p>I love to travel. And the more I travel, the stonger my Wanderlust gets.
    <br>
    <br>

    Eventhough I chose to call this blog "Wanderlust", the blog will be about a very different kind of travel. The travel of learning how to programme!

    <br>
    <br>

    Just like travelling, this will teach me something new. And just like travelling, this will change me. Another thing travel and programming have in common, is that I'm feeling slightly nervous before really starting the journey.

    <br>
    <br>

    The difference is that travelling fills me with anticipation and excitement. So far, programming has filled me with a mild feeling of terror.

    <br>
    <br>

    Hopefully, this programming journey will also lead to a kind of wanderlust - the wish to keep learning programming!

    <br>
    <br>

    So let's start!</p>
